/**
 * This class implements a simple readonly FUSE-based filesystem known as HelloFS.
 *
 * HelloFS presents a virtual file system with a single "hello" file that contains
 * a predefined string. The class overrides and defines the necessary filesystem
 * operations such as `getattr`, `readdir`, `open`, and `read`. Additionally, it
 * provides utility functions to manage paths and file content relevant to the
 * filesystem logic.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Implements basic FUSE operations like retrieving attributes (getattr),
 *   reading directories (readdir), and file I/O operations (open, read).
 * - Exposes an in-memory file system structure with a single root directory and
 *   one file (`helloPath()`) containing predefined content (`helloStr()`).
 * - Encapsulates the root directory path, file path, and file content as private
 *   members, accessed through dedicated getter functions.
 *
 * Note:
 * - This implementation is intended as a minimal example of a FUSE-based filesystem
 *   and is not designed to support complex operations or modifications of the file
 *   system.

     * based on the specified `path`.

     *
     * @return 0 on success, or a negative error code (e.g., -ENOENT) if the path does not exist.
     *
     * Behavior:
     * - If the path matches the root directory (`rootPath()`), the function provides
     *   directory attributes.
     * - If the path matches the file path (`helloPath()`), the function provides
     *   file attributes, including the file's size equal to the length of the string
     *   from `helloStr()`.
     * - If the path does not match any known paths, the function returns -ENOENT.
